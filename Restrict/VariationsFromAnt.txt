Seemed unnecessary:

<restrict cache="true|false" /> (since it's only scanned once, right?)

<restrict>
	<type type="file|dir|any" /> since we're looping through resolved filenames, not <include />|<exclude /> masks
	<instanceof /> since we're only dealing with filenames, and not instanciating their contents
	<size> it's the size of the containing collection, seems pointless
	<compare> what does this do?

</restrict>


Additional Filters Added:

<restrict>
	<filesize> what I thought size was until I looked closer
	<read-only />
	<contains (string=""|regex="") /> Examine file contents for matching line

</restrict>
